    <p class="p">
      Welcome the the About Page to start we will talk about multiple things
      starting with the regions.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Regions</h2>
    <p class="p">There are 7 region in game:</p>
    <ul class="p">
      <li>Mondstadt</li>
      <li>Liyue</li>
      <li>Inazuma</li>
      <li>Sumeru (where the game is currently at)</li>
      <li>Fontaine</li>
      <li>Natlan</li>
      <li>Snezhnaya</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p">Aswell as a ruin region called Khaenri'ah.</p>
    <p class="p">
      Each region has its own element (called visions) any character from any
      region can have any vision.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      Starthing with Mondstadt the God (Archon) is named Barbatos he is the
      Archon of Freedom and uses the vision of anemo (wind). He watched his old
      friend die during the Archon war he then took the form of his dead best
      friend and is now the bard of Mondstadt just like his Friend. In Mondstadt
      you face off aganst a dragon called Dvalin or Stormterror. He was infected
      by the death of the dragon callede Durin in the mountian called Vindagnyr;
      however the mountians have now been renamed DragonSpine.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      Next Is Liyue where the archon named Morax/ Rexlapis resides he is the
      archon of contracts and the user of geo (Rock). You meet a man from
      Snezhnaya called Tartaglia (Childe) where you find out that he is part of
      the Organization called The Fatui who have been after the source of the
      archons power (gnosis) you end up fighting hin and he calles uppon a god
      called Osial the leader of liyue harbor drops her pride and joy the jade
      chamber onto the god and kill it.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      After that you go to Inazuma where the archon of eternity is living
      keeping her nation/region seperated from the rest of the world. The Raiden
      Shogun is her name and she weilds the power of electro (lightning). You
      don't like her because she is doing a vision hunt where she takes the
      visions of her peoples. When your friend named Thoma is chosen to loose
      his vision you try to stop her and you sucessfully stop her from taking
      his vision but you two are now fugitives in the region. You then get the
      idea from a story that you heard that if you fight the shogun and win she
      will let you live so you go to challange her, but when you arrive you meet
      a lady who you knew Signora who instead challanges you to a battle you
      beat her and she perishes into dust you then fight shogun and beat her.
      She learns that eternity will never happen.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      Once you leave Inazuma you reach Sumaru where you find out that the
      origional archon Rukkhadevata had died in the Archon War and created the
      new archon named Kusanali who is the current dendro (Tree) archon and
      archon of wisdom. You find out that shes been trapped by the acadamia
      because they don't approve of her being the new archon. You save her and
      then talk to the son of The Raiden Shogun who is named Scaramouche who
      want to fight you because hes not the electro archon but wants to be. you
      beat him and Kusanali pulls him out of the robot hes been operating and
      stops him fom doing any more harm. The next time you see Kusanali and
      Scaramouche he wants to erase himself from the world and start over. He
      does this and is now named Wanderer everyone but the decenders forgot who
      he is (you are a decender) you end up helping him become a better person
      and he gains his vision and lets you pick his name.
    </p>

    <h2>Wishing</h2>
    <p class="p">
      This section is about the wishing system and will be broken up into
      multiple parts.
    </p>
    <h3>Primogems</h3>
    <p class="p">
      Primosgems also known as primos is the wishing currency. You can gather
      primogems by doing quests, your dailies (we'll get to those later),
      chests, and the hangout quests.
    </p>
    <h3>Aquaint Fates</h3>
    <p class="p">
      The fates you can use to wish on the standard banner. How to gather them
      you say, Primos every 160 primos = 1 aquaint fate you can wish 1 aquaint
      fate or 10 aquaint fates.
    </p>
    <h3>Intertwined Fates</h3>
    <p class="p">
      The fates you can use to wish on the limited banner. Again every 160
      primos for 1 intertwined fate.
    </p>
    <h3>Character Banner</h3>
    <p class="p">
      The character banner is the first of two Limited banners. Every 90 pulls
      you get the highest rarity (5*) characters and every 10 pulls you get a 4*
      character/weapon (lowest a character can get).
    </p>
    <h3>Weapon Banner</h3>
    <p class="p">
      The weapon banner is the other one of the limited banners. Every 80 pulls
      you can get a 5* weapon and every 10 pulls you get a 4* weapon/character.
    </p>
    <h3>Beginners Wish</h3>
    <p class="p">
      This wish is part of the standard wish where you can only do 20 pulls,
      each are 20% off and you can only do 10 pulls (8 aquaint fates per 10
      pull) you have a loqw chance to get a 5* but you are gaurenteed at least 2
      4*s. you will be gaurenteed to get the character Noelle but you can also
      get others too.
    </p>
    <h3>Standard Banner</h3>
    <p class="p">
      This banner has 7 5* characters in it and every single 4* in the game.
      this one works the same as the character wish but you can also get 5*
      weapons aswell.
    </p>
    <h3>Pity</h3>
    <p class="p">
      Pity is a system you have. Every so often you can get a 5* it is random
      but when you get to 70 pity you have a higher chance to get a 5*, HOWEVER
      you can lose something called a 50/50 where you could get one of the 7 5*
      characters on the standard banner and then not get the character you want.
    </p>

    <h2>Domains</h2>
    <p class="p">
      Threr are lots of domains in total there are 5 types of domains.
    </p>
    <h3>One time domains</h3>
    <p class="p">
      These domains are the ones tha are used in the Archon quests (The main
      quest) or are just used to get some primos.
    </p>
    <h3>Weapon Ascension Domains</h3>
    <p class="p">
      Weapons need to be ascended and will need a special item for the weapon.
      There is one weapon domain for every region and the items rotate out of
      the domain, however every Sunday ALL domains have all of their items you
      can farm for.
    </p>
    <h3>Tallent Domains</h3>
    <p class="p">
      The tallent domains are just like the Weapon domain the tallent peices
      rotate and are always open on Sundays and every region has one.
    </p>
    <h3>Artifact Domains</h3>
    <p class="p">
      There are multiple artifact domains per region each only have two types of
      artifacts in every domain that are mainly focused. The artifacts DON'T
      rotate and are open every day.
    </p>
    <h3>Weekly Domains</h3>
